# Snek 3
I just really like making snake so I'm going to make snake 3.0 (I've made it twice before).

So, I was thinking, I really like universal paperclip and a dark room.
Why do I like them? 
They have a fun amount of suprises, and the game just changes.
It even just changes game modes.
So, how do I do that for Snake? 
Incremental?
