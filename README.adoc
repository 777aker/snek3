# Scalability

A game where you're a Snake trying to get food. More food is better. 

I just really like making snake so I'm going to make snake 3.0 (I've made it twice before each time with different twists).

I enjoy universal paperclip, a dark room, uncle chop, and neal.fun's website.
I enjoy the varying mini-games with specific themes.
So this will be a Snake game with various mini-games and mobile games I think were fun. 
It's also a nice small project because I always get overwhelmed with the big ones.
